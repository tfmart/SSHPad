#  SSHPad

ðŸš§ **This is a work in progress!** ðŸš§

This app will allow you to execute AppleScript files on your Mac remotely, straight from your iPad. It will work like an stream deck, it will list all your available scripts as shortcuts and you can execute them with just a tap.

The app will connect with a Mac via SSH and it will support and it will support all iPads with iOS 9 or later, so it's possible to use an old spare iPad on your desk to help automate your tasks
